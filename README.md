# Baby Todo

Please feel free to user and/or expand these lists. Pull Requests welcome.

I couldn't find any _usable_ lists which I could import into my existing todo app, so I thought I would start a repository where anyone can grab the format they need and off you go.

### Disclaimer
All task 'priorities' set are merely based on personal judgement and should be adjusted based on your own opinions. These lists are also by no means complete, and are intended to be a start to get you going.

## Credits

These lists were built from the fantastic [Mother care 'everything you might need for you and your baby' list](http://www.mothercare.com/new-baby-essentials/advice-ms-preg-essentials-root,default,pg.html).
